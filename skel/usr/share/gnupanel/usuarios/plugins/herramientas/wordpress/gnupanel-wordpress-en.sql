It is true that these stats can be inflated by artificial means and Mashable&#8217;s Cashmore thinks that their numbers really mean nothing because of how &#8220;easily&#8221; they can be inflated but are stats all that bad? If the numbers help a blogger stay on top of his or her work and helps them stay motivated and attract more readers and as long as the numbers are not completely made up, I say they are worth the money we pay for them (which is free if you are wondering). I am not sure how the feed stats revealed by Google will help people subscribe to a feed, but they are a step in the right direction. If you are a blogger with just a few subscribers and are looking for more (I have a couple of nascent blogs), and are looking to attract more readers, try harder to write better content and participate in the conversation inside and outside of your blog.</p>";}i:41;a:7:{s:5:"title";s:60:"Weblog Tools Collection: WordPress Plugin Releases for
